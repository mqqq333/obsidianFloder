缩短行人感知等待时间: 红灯时节奏和音调对行人声信号的影响

长时间等待红灯会导致负面体验和闯红灯行为。为了缩短行人的经验等待时间，本研究探讨了行人声信号中的节奏和音高对时间估计的影响。在一个等待红灯的模拟任务中，我们比较了行人对三个持续时间(30秒，45秒，60秒)的等待时间的估计，同时操纵了音调的节奏(40bpm，60bpm，120bpm，bpm 作为每分钟的拍子数)和音调(175Hz，350Hz，700Hz)。结果表明，行人对等待时间的估计随着节奏的减小而减小，但在不同的音高下没有显著差异。为了验证实际交叉口情景下节奏对时间估计的影响，我们随机抽取了6个站点的217名行人，对他们在不同节奏下的等待时间进行了调查。研究结果对交通灯的听觉信号设计具有一定的参考价值。


行人通常在过马路时发生交通事故。作为易受伤害的道路使用者，他们往往在与交叉口车辆的相互作用中受伤甚至死亡。为了避免交互，目前的交通系统根据信号灯的状态分配道路权限。行人只能在绿灯时过马路，红灯时必须等候。因此，在日常生活中等待红灯变得普遍和不可避免。然而，长时间的等待在解决旧问题的同时也带来了新的问题。

A consistent finding on the effect of long waiting time is violations of traffic signals (Houten et al., 2002; Tiwari et al., 2007). For example, Yang and Sun (2013) showed that waiting time for the red light is the most effective predictor of self-reported red-light running behavior. Brosseau et al. (2013) also found that a 10% increase in the length of the red phase is associated with 7.9% increase in the probability of violation. Since pedestrian going against red light faced a risk level eight times as high as those obeyers (King et al., 2009), the intended protection from traffic light decreases. Besides, researchers in service management have found that people accumulate psychological stress in the waiting process (Gzyl and Osuna, 2013), which can impair the evaluation of the waiting experience. Therefore, reducing pedestrians’ waiting times is important not only for pedestrian safety, but also for pedestrian overall level of service.

To reduce pedestrians’ waiting time, researchers have incorporated pedestrian needs into the algorithms of optimizing signal cycles and designed pedestrian activated signal lights (e.g. Pécheux et al., 2009; Turky et al., 2009). Although these methods will decrease pedestrians’ waiting time, there is a floor level for pedestrian waiting time due to the increasing car ownership and potential traffic congestion. Therefore, this study explored how to reduce pedestrians’ perceived waiting time when the actual waiting duration is not shortened.

一个关于长时间等待影响的一致发现是违反交通信号(Houten 等，2002; Tiwari 等，2007)。例如，Yang 和 Sun (2013)表明，等待红灯的时间是自我报告的红灯跑步行为的最有效的预测因子。Brosseau 等(2013)还发现，红色阶段长度增加10% 与违反概率增加7.9% 有关。由于违反红灯的行人面临的风险水平是那些遵守者的8倍(King et al。 ，2009) ，预期的红灯保护减少了。此外，服务管理领域的研究人员发现，人们在等待过程中积累了心理压力(Gzyl 和 Osuna，2013) ，这会损害对等待经历的评估。因此，减少行人的等候时间不仅对行人安全，而且对行人的整体服务水平都很重要。

为了减少行人的等待时间，研究人员已经将行人需求纳入优化信号周期的算法中，并设计了行人激活信号灯(例如 Pécheux 等，2009; Turky 等，2009)。虽然这些方法会减少行人的等候时间，但由于车辆拥有量的增加和潜在的交通堵塞，行人的等候时间是有底层的。因此，本研究探讨在不缩短实际等候时间的情况下，如何减少行人的知觉等候时间。

***如何减少预计的轮候时间？***
Changing perceived waiting time without shortening the actual waiting time has been seen in a study on pedestrian behavior change. Keegan and O’Mahony (2003) found that when a countdown timer is available at red phase, the proportion of pedestrians’ overestimation significantly reduced. An explanation is that the countdown timer eliminated the uncertainty of the waiting time. Psychologists also proved that uncertainty will attract attention to the waiting time, and finally increase time estimation (Fleisig et al., 2009; Zakay, 1992). Besides attention allocated to time, the arousal state of the perceiver also influences perceived waiting time, with higher arousal resulting in longer time estimation (Cocenassilva et al., 2011). A direct deduction from the phenomenon is that we can shorten perceived waiting time by lowering pedestrian arousal state while waiting at the red light. The manipulation is feasible based on findings from music psychology and current design features of pedestrian signal lights.

In music psychology, researchers have reached a consensus view that arousal level is related with psychoacoustic features of sound such as tempo, pitch level and loudness (Cocenassilva et al., 2011; Coutinho and Cangelosi, 2011; Gomez and Danuser, 2007; Husain et al., 2002). Therefore, we can control people’s arousal level by changing the psychoacoustic features of sound. In the context of crossing road, the sound can be controlled are the audio prompts in audible signal lights. Designed for blind pedestrians, audible signals in China are signal lights equipped with buzzers to produce pure sounds like "di", "di", "di". Currently, the sounds were emitted at a faster tempo at red phase than at green phase, but the frequency remain constant. The different tempos were designed to help blind pedestrians recognize the state of the signal. However, for other pedestrians, different design options may also influence arousal level, so that the experienced waiting time can be affected. This study is an attempt to test whether two common psychoacoustic features (tempo and pitch) affect perceived waiting time. Following musical terminology, tempo is defined as the speed or pace of a given piece. Pitch is reflected by the frequency of a pure tone or the fundamental frequency of a complex tones.

***本研究的刺激因素和假设***
As a brief summary, psychoacoustic features (pitch and tempo) of sound have the potential to influence time estimation. Higher tempo is generally supposed to result in time overestimation and higher pitch, although less clear, may lead to longer estimation. However, these effects are contingent on many factors like the duration, context, and tasks. Therefore, the goals of this study were to explore how pitch and tempo of audible signals influence pedestrians’ time estimation while waiting for a red light. 
In this study, we tested the effect of pitch and tempo on pedestrians’ time estimation in both simulated and real task of waiting at the red light. We hypothesize that low tempo of audible pedestrian signal can reduce pedestrians’ time estimation. The decreased pitch may have the same effect on time estimation, however, not as strong as tempo. The findings of the study will guide future design of audible signals in pedestrian lights to reduce perceived waiting time.
简而言之，声音的心理声学特征(音高和节奏)有可能影响时间估计。较高的节奏通常会导致时间估计过高，而较高的音高虽然不那么清晰，但可能会导致较长的估计时间。然而，这些影响取决于许多因素，如持续时间、上下文和任务。因此，本研究的目的是探讨在等待红灯时，声音信号的音调和节奏对行人时间估计的影响。

本研究在模拟等待红灯和实际等待红灯的任务中，测试了音高和节奏对行人时间估计的影响。我们假设低节奏的行人可听信号可以减少行人的时间估计。音高的降低对时间估计的影响可能相同，但不如节奏的影响大。这项研究的结果将指导未来设计行人灯的声音信号，以减少感知的等待时间。

缩短行人感知等待时间: 红灯时节奏和音调对行人声信号的影响

长时间等待红灯会导致负面体验和闯红灯行为。为了缩短行人的经验等待时间，本研究探讨了行人声信号中的节奏和音高对时间估计的影响。在一个等待红灯的模拟任务中，我们比较了行人对三个持续时间(30秒，45秒，60秒)的等待时间的估计，同时操纵了音调的节奏(40bpm，60bpm，120bpm，bpm 作为每分钟的拍子数)和音调(175Hz，350Hz，700Hz)。结果表明，行人对等待时间的估计随着节奏的减小而减小，但在不同的音高下没有显著差异。为了验证实际交叉口情景下节奏对时间估计的影响，我们随机抽取了6个站点的217名行人，对他们在不同节奏下的等待时间进行了调查。研究结果对交通灯的听觉信号设计具有一定的参考价值。


行人通常在过马路时发生交通事故。作为易受伤害的道路使用者，他们往往在与交叉口车辆的相互作用中受伤甚至死亡。为了避免交互，目前的交通系统根据信号灯的状态分配道路权限。行人只能在绿灯时过马路，红灯时必须等候。因此，在日常生活中等待红灯变得普遍和不可避免。然而，长时间的等待在解决旧问题的同时也带来了新的问题。

A consistent finding on the effect of long waiting time is violations of traffic signals (Houten et al., 2002; Tiwari et al., 2007). For example, Yang and Sun (2013) showed that waiting time for the red light is the most effective predictor of self-reported red-light running behavior. Brosseau et al. (2013) also found that a 10% increase in the length of the red phase is associated with 7.9% increase in the probability of violation. Since pedestrian going against red light faced a risk level eight times as high as those obeyers (King et al., 2009), the intended protection from traffic light decreases. Besides, researchers in service management have found that people accumulate psychological stress in the waiting process (Gzyl and Osuna, 2013), which can impair the evaluation of the waiting experience. Therefore, reducing pedestrians’ waiting times is important not only for pedestrian safety, but also for pedestrian overall level of service.

To reduce pedestrians’ waiting time, researchers have incorporated pedestrian needs into the algorithms of optimizing signal cycles and designed pedestrian activated signal lights (e.g. Pécheux et al., 2009; Turky et al., 2009). Although these methods will decrease pedestrians’ waiting time, there is a floor level for pedestrian waiting time due to the increasing car ownership and potential traffic congestion. Therefore, this study explored how to reduce pedestrians’ perceived waiting time when the actual waiting duration is not shortened.

***本研究的刺激因素和假设***
As a brief summary, psychoacoustic features (pitch and tempo) of sound have the potential to influence time estimation. Higher tempo is generally supposed to result in time overestimation and higher pitch, although less clear, may lead to longer estimation. However, these effects are contingent on many factors like the duration, context, and tasks. Therefore, the goals of this study were to explore how pitch and tempo of audible signals influence pedestrians’ time estimation while waiting for a red light. 
In this study, we tested the effect of pitch and tempo on pedestrians’ time estimation in both simulated and real task of waiting at the red light. We hypothesize that low tempo of audible pedestrian signal can reduce pedestrians’ time estimation. The decreased pitch may have the same effect on time estimation, however, not as strong as tempo. The findings of the study will guide future design of audible signals in pedestrian lights to reduce perceived waiting time.

# Homework1

A researcher aims to analyze the data of a questionnaire in order to figure out its underlying structure. A total of 200 participants completed 20 questions in this questionnaire. The homework required you to complete the following tasks and explain the reasons:
1.     Use SPSS to conduct explorative factor analysis (EFA) to find out how many factors can be extracted from these 20 items; which items belong to each factor;

'c7', ‘c8’, 'c9', 'c10', 'c11', 'c13', 'c14', 'c16', 'c18' belong to factor1.
'c7', ‘c14’, 'c15', 'c16', 'c17', 'c18', 'c19' belong to factor2.
'c1', ‘c2’, 'c3', 'c4', 'c5', 'c6' belong to factor3.
'c1', ‘c12’ belong to factor4.
'c20' belong to factor5.
2.     Decide which items were not good enough to be included in the questionnaire and provide suggestions regarding how to optimize the questionnaire;

'c6', 'c12', 'c20' are less relevant with other items, we can delete them
'c1', 'c7', 'c14', 'c16', 'c18'  intersect in different factors, we can delete them.
3.     Redo the factor analysis while not using the items that were not good;

‘c8’, 'c9', 'c10', 'c11', 'c13' belong to factor1.
‘c2’, 'c3', 'c4', 'c5' belong to factor2.
‘c15', 'c17', 'c19' belong to factor3.
4.     Generate the factor scores by means of the regression method.

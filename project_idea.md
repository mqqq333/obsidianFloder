Using HCP:

1Â - compare network connectivity in resting state vs during a task

2 - map stimulus representations in different brain areas during working memory

3 - compare activity/connectivity between different working memory load conditions (0-back, 1-back, 2-back)

4 - compare network connectivity/task-based activity between age groups/other subgroups we can define (e.g. substance users,)

5 - compare brain connectivity vs activity in specific regions as predictors of behavior performance on the n-back task

1- compare between gambling (rewarding system) and relational data accuracy of patients

2- effect of emotions on the relational task activity

  

1- connection between the perception of a new language and an emotional state?

2- motor measures of gambling behavior for different groups

  

using HCP:

1- mapping functional connectivity in gambling behavior, can also consider effect of substance use / emotional state

2- gender differences in social cognition/language processing (but not sure how to model?

3- attractor model of decision making in gambling (not sure if its possible and how to use this data set

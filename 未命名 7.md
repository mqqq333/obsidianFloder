${1\over2m}\sum\nolimits_{i=1}^m(h_\theta(x^i) - y^i)^2$. What is $J(0)$
$\large \{x^{(1)}, ... , x^{(m)} \}$ and you want to detect outliers in the dataset. You first plot the dataset and it looks like this:<img='./image/q_42_1.png'>Suppose you fit the gaussian distribution parameters $\large \mu_1 and \large \sigma_1^2$ to this dataset.Which of the following values for $\large \mu_1 and \large \sigma_1^2$ might you get



$x_1,x_2 \in \{0,1\} and outputs h_\theta(x)$. Which of the following logical functions does it (approximately) compute?


$h_\theta(x) = g(\theta_0 + \theta_1 x_1 + \theta_2 x_2 + \theta_3 x_1^2 + \theta_4 x_1 x_2 + \theta_5 x_2^2 )$

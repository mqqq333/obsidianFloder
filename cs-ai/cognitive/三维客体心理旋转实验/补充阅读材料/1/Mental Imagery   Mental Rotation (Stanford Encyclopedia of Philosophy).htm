<h2>Mental Rotation</h2>

<p>

Shepard &amp; Metzler (1971) introduced the concept of mental 
rotation into cognitive science with what has become one of the 
best-known experiments in the field. This fame may, in part, be 
because the experiment is associated with a set of memorable 
graphical images (e.g., figure 1), some of which made it onto the 
cover of the issue of <em>Science</em> where it was first published. 
However, it is also a remarkably elegant experiment, that produced 
some strikingly clear results. The findings seemed directly to refute
the Behaviorist doctrine, still holding considerable sway amongst 
psychologists at the time, that thought processes depend entirely 
upon language. By suggesting that analog representations have an 
important role to play in thinking, the findings also raised 
<em>prima facie</em> difficulties (though not necessarily 
insurmountable ones) for the (digital) computer model of the mind 
that lay at the heart of the newly emerging field of cognitive 
science (Block, 1983a).</p>

<p align="center">


 <strong><img src="./Mental Imagery   Mental Rotation (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)_files/shepmetz.gif" alt="Ten cube assemblages" width="400" height="544"> <br> Figure 1 <br> </strong>Some of the stimulus 
figure pairs used by Shepard &amp; Metzler (1971). <br> A- 
Identical objects differing by a rotation in the plane of the page 
<br> B – Identical objects differing by a rotation in depth 
<br> C – Mirror-image objects (also rotated in depth)</p>

<p>

Shepard &amp; Metzler presented their subjects with pairs of drawings
of three-dimensional, asymmetrical assemblages of cubes, as shown in 
figure 1 A, B, and C. In each pair, the right-hand picture either 
showed an assemblage identical to that shown on the left, but rotated
from the original position by a certain amount, or else it showed an 
assemblage that was not only rotated, but was also the mirror image 
of the one to the left (figure 1 C). The experimental task was to 
tell, as quickly as possible (by pressing a button) whether the two 
objects depicted were in fact identical (except for rotation), or 
were mirror images. Shepard's hypothesis was that the task would be 
done by forming a three-dimensional mental image of one of the 
depicted objects, and rotating this whole image, in the imagination, 
to see whether it could be brought into correspondence with the other
picture. The experimental results clearly supported this idea, 
because it was found that, for each subject, the time taken to 
confirm that both objects of a pair were, in fact, identical, 
increased in direct proportion to the angular rotational difference 
between them. It was as if the subjects were rotating their mental 
image at a steady rate (although this might be different for each 
subject), so that the further they had to go to bring their image 
into correspondence with the reference picture, the longer it would 
take them. On post-experimental questioning, most of the subjects 
confirmed that this was indeed how they believed that they had done 
the task. (Interestingly, it made no difference whether the rotation 
was in the plane of the page, or in depth.)</p>

<p>

Despite the elegance of this experiment, and the clear-cut results 
(nice linear plots of reaction time against rotational angle), 
Shepard's interpretation of it as evidence for irreducibly analog and
intrinsically spatial processes in thinking, and for what he called a
“second order isomorphism” between image and object 
(Shepard, 1975, 1978b, 1981, 1984), certainly did not go 
unquestioned. Some researchers challenged Shepard's contention that 
his results show that images are rotated as a whole, rather than 
their parts being compared in a piecemeal fashion (Hochberg &amp; 
Gellman, 1977; Pylyshyn, 1979a; Yuille, 1983). More radically, some 
have doubted whether the rotation task really involves imagery at all
(Marks, 1999). After all, unlike in the experiments with imagery 
mnemonics, the subjects were never explicitly told to use imagery in 
performing the comparison task, and alternative explanations of the 
result (i.e., the linear relation between reaction time and angle of 
rotation) are conceivable. For example, Just &amp; Carpenter (1976; 
Carpenter &amp; Just, 1978), who tracked subjects' eye movements 
whilst they did a version of the Shepard &amp; Metzler task, argued 
that the linear increase in reaction time arose not from the inner 
rotation of an image, but from a need to make more eye movements 
between the two pictures (in order to compare their features) the 
more they were rotated relative to one another. In the iconophobic 
culture that still prevailed in psychology in the early 1970s such an
“imageless” interpretation of the results was still very 
much a live option. Of course, it meant that any claims by subjects 
to have formed and rotated mental images had to be discounted, but 
Behaviorism had long since taught psychologists to give very little 
weight to this sort of subjective, introspective 
 data.<sup>[<a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mental-imagery/notes.html#SupMenRot1" name="note-SupMenRot1">1</a>]</sup>
 </p>

<p>

However, the case for mental rotation does not rest solely on this 
one celebrated experiment. Shepard and his students (especially Lynn 
Cooper) were subsequently able to demonstrate mental rotation and 
other related effects in quite a number of different experimental 
designs (see Shepard &amp; Cooper <em>et al</em>., 1982) mostly 
designed to block alternative interpretations of the results that 
would avoid the need to postulate rotating imagery. Most of these 
other experiments did not involve the comparison of two 
simultaneously visible pictures, thus leaving no scope for the sort 
of eye movement explanation that Just &amp; Carpenter had suggested. 
For example, Cooper &amp; Shepard (1973) presented their subjects a 
letter of the alphabet rotated out of its normal, upright 
orientation, and asked them, again, to indicate whether the letter 
was in its normal form or its mirror image (backward) (see figure 2).
Once again the response time was found to increase the further the 
stimulus letter was rotated from upright (although, for reasons that 
need not detain us, the relationship was not so neatly linear as in 
the earlier experiment). The implied explanation is that the subjects
rotate their image of the non-upright letter that they are shown into
its canonical upright orientation, in order to compare it to their 
memory of how the letter would normally look.</p>

 <strong>Figure 2 <br> </strong> Rotated letter stimuli of 
the sort used by Cooper &amp; Shepard (1973).</p>

<p>

Cooper (e.g., 1975, 1976) also did several experiments on the mental 
rotation of complex irregular polygons, such as those in figure 3, 
and some of this work depended on the subjects being explicitly told 
to form and rotate mental images of the polygons (whose shape they 
had previously memorized). Once again, a linear dependence of 
reaction time upon angle was found, suggesting smooth, regular 
rotation of an image. An advantage of the explicit imagery 
instructions used in these experiments is that it forges a more 
explicit link between the measured results and imagery as a conscious
experience under voluntary control. On the other hand, it opens up 
the very real possibility that the results might be explained away as
the result of “experimental demand” (essentially, the 
subjects deliberately trying to produce the results that they believe
the experimenters want, regardless of the actual underlying cognitive
processes involved). This is well known to psychologists to be a very
real problem in many areas of experimental psychological research 
(Orne, 1962), and it has been shown to be particularly problematic in
imagery research of this type (Intons-Peterson, 1983). However, when 
these experiments of Cooper's are taken together with the other 
rotation experiments that did not use explicit imagery instructions, 
and gave little foothold for experimental demand to influence the 
results (e.g., Shepard &amp; Metzler, 1971; Shepard &amp; Cooper, 
1973) (and other experiments not discussed here: see Shepard &amp; 
Cooper <em>et al</em>., 1982) they make a powerful case for the 
reality and robustness of the mental rotation phenomenon.</p>

<p>

Evidence for mental rotation being used by animals has proven elusive
(Hollard &amp; Delius, 1982; Rilling &amp; Neiworth, 1987; Hopkins <em>et al</em>., 1993; Köhler 
<em>et al</em>., 2005), but the effect has been demonstrated in
congenitally blind human subjects (Marmor &amp; Zaback, 1976;
Carpenter &amp; Eisenberg, 1978), who are generally presumed to be
rotating haptic or kinesthetic rather than visual imagery. Mental
rotation abilities have been studied in infants (Örnkloo &amp;
von Hofsten, 2007), the elderly (Dror <em>et al</em>., 2005), and in
people with neurological problems (Courbois <em>et al</em>., 2004;
Hinnell &amp; Virji-Babul, 2004), and age, sex, and even
sexual-orientation related differences in its performance have been
investigated (e.g., Richardson, 1994;; Terlecki &amp; Newcombe, 2005;
Levin <em>et al</em>., 2005; Quaiser-Pohl <em>et al,</em>. 2006;
Maylor <em>et al</em>., 2007; Joanisse <em>et al</em>.,
2008). Furthermore, the mental rotation concept has been applied to
practical issues ranging from the improvement of surgical technique
(Conrad <em>et al</em>., 2006) to the understanding and treatment of
dyslexia (Russeler <em>et al</em>., 2005).</p>

<p>

Controversy continues about the underlying mechanisms of mental
rotation (as of imagery in general), but these have recently been
investigated by several neuroscientific techniques, such as eye
movement measurements (de'Sperati, 2003), direct recording from
electrodes implanted in the brain (Georgopoulos <em>et al</em>.,
1989), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (e.g., Cohen
<em>et al</em>., 1996; Richter <em>et al</em>., 2000; Creem <em>et
al</em>., 2001; Koshino <em>et al</em>., 2005; O'Boyle <em>et
al</em>., 2005), and transcranial magnetic stimulation (Ganis <em>et
al</em>., 2000). Some of this research has been focused on
“motor imagery” (Jeannerod, 1994) rather than visual
imagery. However, there are reasons to believe that motor processes
and motor areas of the brain may be involved in mental rotation quite
generally (Kosslyn, 1994; Wexler, Kosslyn &amp; Berthoz, 1998;
Wohlschläger, 2001; Tomasino <em>et al</em>., 2005; Amorim <em>et
al</em>., 2006; Eisenegger <em>et al</em>., 2007).</p>
